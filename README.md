Your Experiance

Please report, if you sucessfully used one of the untested installation methodes.
Even better, clone the repo, update this file, add others as needed, send a pull request.

What makes it unique?
=====================

Comparism to other vim syntax highlighting for TypoScript:

 * **Others**: Exessive use of *keywords* to detect the higlighted items.
 * **This**: *Syntax analyses* by use regular experessions to detect the items.

Future improvement: Merge best of both worlds.

Motivation
